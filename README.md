Converts PE so that it can be then injected just like a normal shellcode.<br/>
(At the same time, the output file remains to be a valid PE).<br/>
<b>Supports both 32 and 64 bit PEs</b>

Objective:
-
The goal of this project is to provide a possibility to generate PE files that can be injected with minimal effort.
It is inspired by Stephen Fewer's [ReflectiveDLLInjection](https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection) - but the difference is that with pe2shc you can add the reflective loading stub post-compilation. Also, the header of the PE file is modified in such a way, that you can start executing the injected buffer from the very beginning - just like you would do with a shellcode. It will automatically find the stub, and continue loading the full PE.

Clone:
-
Use recursive clone to get the repo together with all the submodules:
<pre>
git clone --recursive https://github.com/hasherezade/pe_to_shellcode.git
</pre>

How to use it:
-
1. Use **pe2shc.exe** to convert a PE of your choice:
```
pe2shc.exe <path to your PE> [output path*]
* - optional
```
If the PE was successfuly converted, **pe2shc** will let you know where the output was saved:
```
[+] Saved to file: <converted file>
```
i.e.
```
[+] Saved to file: test_file.shc.exe
```
2. Use **runshc.exe**(*) to run the output file and check if the conversion went fine.
```
runshc.exe <converted file>
```

(*)Warning: remember to use the version of **runshc** with a bitness appropriate to your converted application (32 or 64 bit) - otherwise the application will crash!

3. If the file runs as the original PE, it confirms that the conversion was successful!<br/>
Now you can use the converted PE just like you would use a shellcode: inject it to a target and execute from the beginning of the buffer. No additional PE loaders are required.<br/>
At the same time, you can keep using the converted file as a regular PE.
